Many patterns and pattern files available at:

.lif file to pattern

React search bar for patterns with sorting for pattern types
  * How to group these?

Drag and drop or autoplace pattern in center

Play, pause, step back, step forward, reset buttons
  * Keep history of the past 100 steps or so.

Zoom buttons
  * Smallest could be pixel level. Can you go smaller than that?

Create a directory of .lif 1.06 files and automatically load these in
  * Could automatically download these or keep a rolling archive
  
Grid width and height must be divisible by box size.  Grid may need to be resized slightly to enforce this.

Break up handleFillBox into multiple functions.
* Also modify this to draw a single box with a given color.

gridArr should not be global.  This should all be part of a class.
